Exercise 1: nslookup

1. IP address of www.netflix.com is given as multiple addresses:
Name:	apiproxy-website-nlb-prod-2-e98cb8cf33ff3581.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Address: 44.242.60.85
Name:	apiproxy-website-nlb-prod-2-e98cb8cf33ff3581.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Address: 44.234.232.238
Name:	apiproxy-website-nlb-prod-2-e98cb8cf33ff3581.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Address: 44.237.234.25
Name:	apiproxy-website-nlb-prod-2-e98cb8cf33ff3581.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Address: 2600:1f14:62a:de82:822d:a423:9e4c:da8d
Name:	apiproxy-website-nlb-prod-2-e98cb8cf33ff3581.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Address: 2600:1f14:62a:de80:69a8:7b12:8e5f:855d
Name:	apiproxy-website-nlb-prod-2-e98cb8cf33ff3581.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Address: 2600:1f14:62a:de81:b848:82ee:2416:447e

There are 2 versions of IP addresses shown above:
    - IPv4, which is a 32-bit number expressed in decimal form.
    - IPv6, a newer 128-bit version, which allows for a greater number of unique addresses, 
    and expressed with the columns seperated.

The reason that Netflix have multiple IP addresses is because Netflix has to distribute traffic
across multiple servers to balance the load. Since Netflix is a large online service, it uses
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to deliver content efficiently worldwide. CDNs use a network
of servers to provide fast delivery of internet content, which involves using multiple 
IP addresses.

2. This IP address is for the localhost and it is special for a number of reasons:
    - Loopback interface: localhost address points to the loopback network interface. This means that network
    traffic sent to this address is looped back to the local machine, allowing the computer to 
    talk to itself.

    - Developers can use localhost for testing and devloping software because it simulates
    network communication wihtout the network overhead and without leving the system.


Exercise 2: ping

www.cse.unsw.edu.au --> reachable. 
www.getfittest.com.au --> unreachable. The error from the when searching URL on chrome responds
    DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN error. This is most likely due to DNS server problems, since
    ping is dont able to send its packets, then there is most likely problem with DNS server or
    the domain does not exist.
www.mit.edu --> reachable.
www.intel.com.au --> reachable.
www.tpg.com.au --> unreachable by ping, 100% packet loss. But reachable by web browser. Possible
    reasons include firewall or security settings, or ICMP blocking. 
www.hola.hp --> unreachable as "name or service unknown". This is most likely due to incorrect
    host name and instead of hp should be .com.
www.amazon.com --> reachable.
www.tsinghua.edu.cn --> reachable.
www.kremlin.ru --> unreachable. .ru is a the country code for Russai and is a must have for all 
    russain domain names.
8.8.8.8 --> reachable.


Exercise 3: traceroute

1. Total of 25 routers. Between routers 9 and 10 the packet cross the Pacific Ocean, since
    there is a relatively large propagation delay between these two routers. I also used
    "yougetyoursignal" which showed that the IP address of router 10 is located in United States.

2. All 3 paths to host follows the same path below before diverging.

 1  cserouter1-server.orchestra.cse.unsw.EDU.AU (129.94.242.251)  0.057 ms  0.048 ms  0.047 ms
 2  129.94.39.17 (129.94.39.17)  0.858 ms  0.873 ms  0.868 ms
 3  172.17.31.154 (172.17.31.154)  1.590 ms  1.557 ms  1.978 ms
 4  po-3-1902.ombcr1.gw.unsw.edu.au (129.94.24.20)  1.138 ms  1.234 ms  1.200 ms
 5  unswbr1-te-1-9.gw.unsw.edu.au (149.171.255.101)  1.136 ms  1.152 ms unswbr1-te-2-13.gw.unsw.edu.au (149.171.255.105)  1.110 ms
 6  138.44.5.0 (138.44.5.0)  3.971 ms  3.377 ms  3.421 ms

The router that all 3 paths diverge belongs to Australian Academic and Research Network. 
Also known as AARNet Pty Ltd. 

3. 
IP address of www.speedtest.com.sg = 202.150.221.170
IP address of www.telstra.net = 203.50.5.178

Hostname IP address = 129.94.242.120
While some addresses look similar for packet paths, the forward and reverse paths do not
go through the same routers. This is because of different routing policies and routing protocol used.
Since routing decisions are made dynamically based on the network's current state, changes in network
topology, such as link failures, congestions or others, can cause routers to redirect traffic 
along a different path.
